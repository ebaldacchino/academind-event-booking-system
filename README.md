# Event Booking System

I made this basic event booking system at least 6 months ago using an [Academind tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7giZGFDGnkc&list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_). I'm just updating it now because I just used it as a reference for using ObjectId's when defining a schema in mongoose.

Technologies include:
    GraphQL
    React (CRA)
    MongoDB (ODM: mongoose)
    JWT's

The environment variables used are:
    MONGO_URI
    JWT_KEY
    PORT
